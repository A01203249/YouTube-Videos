#In computer science and data mining, Apriori is a classic algorithm for learning association rules. Apriori is designed to operate on databases containing transactions. As is common in association rule mining, given a set of itemsets, the algorithm attempts to find subsets which are common to at least a minimum number C of the itemsets. Apriori uses a "bottom up" approach, where frequent subsets are extended one item at a time (a step known as candidate generation), and groups of candidates are tested against the data. The algorithm terminates when no further successful extensions are found.
#Apriori uses breadth-first search and a tree structure to count candidate item sets efficiently. It generates candidate item sets of length k from item sets of length k-1. Then it prunes the candidates which have an infrequent sub pattern. According to the downward closure lemma, the candidate set contains all frequent k-length item sets. After that, it scans the transaction database to determine frequent item sets among the candidates.
#Apriori, while historically significant, suffers from a number of inefficiencies or trade-offs, which have spawned other algorithms. Candidate generation generates large numbers of subsets (the algorithm attempts to load up the candidate set with as many as possible before each scan). Bottom-up subset exploration (essentially a breadth-first traversal of the subset lattice) finds any maximal subset S only after all 2^{|S|}-1 of its proper subsets.

#We then set rhs=c("Survived=No", "Survived=Yes") in appearance to make sure that only "Survived=No" and "Survived=Yes" will appear in the rhs of rules.
# rules with rhs containing "Survived" only

#Pruning Redundant Rules
#In the above result, rule 2 provides no extra knowledge in addition to rule 1, since rules 1 tells us that all 2nd-class children survived. 
#Generally speaking, when a rule (such as rule 2) is a super rule of another rule (such as rule 1) and the former has the same or a lower lift, 
#the former rule (rule 2) is considered to be redundant. Below we prune redundant rules.
